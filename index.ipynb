At a minimum, this should include:\n", "\n", "* Loading the data (which is stored in the file ``ames_train.csv``) \n", "* Use built-in Python functions to explore measures of centrality and dispersion for at least 3 variables\n", "* Create *meaningful* subsets of the data using selection operations like `.loc`, `.iloc`, or related operations.   Explain why you used the chosen subsets and do this for three possible 2-way splits. State how you think the two measures of centrality and/or dispersion might be different for each subset of the data.\n", "* Next, use histograms and scatter plots to see whether you observe differences for the subsets of the data.
