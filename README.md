# Project - EDA with Pandas Using the Ames Housing Data

## Introduction

In this section, you've learned a lot about importing, cleaning up, analyzing (using descriptive statistics) and visualizing data. In this more free-form project, you'll get a chance to practice all of these skills with the Ames Housing dataset, which contains housing values in the suburbs of Ames.

## Objectives

You will be able to:

* Perform a full exploratory data analysis process to gain insight about a dataset 

## Goals

Use your data munging and visualization skills to conduct an exploratory analysis of the dataset below. At a minimum, this should include:

* Loading the data (which is stored in the file ``ames_train.csv``) 
* Use built-in Python functions to explore measures of centrality and dispersion for at least 3 variables
* Create *meaningful* subsets of the data using selection operations like `.loc`, `.iloc`, or related operations.   Explain why you used the chosen subsets and do this for three possible 2-way splits. State how you think the two measures of centrality and/or dispersion might be different for each subset of the data.
* Next, use histograms and scatter plots to see whether you observe differences for the subsets of the data. Make sure to use subplots so it is easy to compare the relationships.

## Variable Descriptions
Look in ``data_description.txt`` for a full description of all variables.

A preview of some of the columns:

**MSZoning**: Identifies the general zoning classification of the sale.
		
       A	 Agriculture
       C	 Commercial
       FV	Floating Village Residential
       I	 Industrial
       RH	Residential High Density
       RL	Residential Low Density
       RP	Residential Low Density Park 
       RM	Residential Medium Density

**OverallCond**: Rates the overall condition of the house

       10	Very Excellent
       9	 Excellent
       8	 Very Good
       7	 Good
       6	 Above Average	
       5	 Average
       4	 Below Average	
       3	 Fair
       2	 Poor
       1	 Very Poor

**KitchenQual**: Kitchen quality

       Ex	Excellent
       Gd	Good
       TA	Typical/Average
       Fa	Fair
       Po	Poor

**YrSold**: Year Sold (YYYY)

**SalePrice**: Sale price of the house in dollars


```python
# Let's get started importing the necessary libraries
```


```python
# Loading the data
```


```python

df.info()
```


```python
# Investigating Distributions using scatter_matrix
```


```python
# Create a plot that shows the SalePrice Distribution
```


```python
# Create a plot that shows the LotArea Distribution
```


```python
# Create a plot that shows the Distribution of the overall house condition
```


```python
# Create a Box Plot for SalePrice
```


```python
# Perform an Exploration of home values by age
```

## Summary

Congratulations, you've completed your first "free form" exploratory data analysis of a popular dataset!
